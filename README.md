# BNKReplacer
A tool to replace existing sound files within Wwise BNK audio archives.

# Capabilities
BNKReplacer **CAN**...
* Replace existing WEM files present inside of a BNK file with substitute WEM files you specify.
* Replace existing WEM files with basically anything. Hell, pack a meme in for a sound for all I care. It'll break the game. But hey, it works.

BNKReplacer **CAN NOT**...
* Add new files to a BNK. Sorry. That requires some modification of other parts of the BNK file that isn't documented. :(
* Remove files from the BNK. Same reason as above.

# Usage:
## Step 1: Make a file and a folder in the same directory as the EXE.

## Step 2: Write a list of IDs in the text document. These IDs should be the IDs of files within the BNK file you're going to modify.
